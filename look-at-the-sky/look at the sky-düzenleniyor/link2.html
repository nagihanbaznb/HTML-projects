            <h2>GEMINI <small>(May 21 - June 20)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Gentle, affectionate, curious, adaptable, ability to learn quickly and exchange ideas</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Nervous, inconsistent, indecisive</p>
            <p><b>Gemini likes:</b> Music, books, magazines, chats with nearly anyone, short trips around the town</p>
            <p><b>Gemini dislikes:</b> Being alone, being confined, repetition and routine</p>
            <p>Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different personalities in one and you will never be sure which one you will face. They are sociable, communicative and ready for fun, with a tendency to suddenly get serious, thoughtful and restless. They are fascinated with the world itself, extremely curious, with a constant feeling that there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see.</p>
            <p>The sign of Gemini belongs to the element of Air, accompanying <a href="link4.html">Libra</a> and <a href="link6.html">Aquarius</a>, and this connects it to all aspects of the mind. It is ruled by Mercury, the planet that represents communication, writing, and movement. People born under this Sun sign often have a feeling that their other half is missing, so they are forever seeking new friends, mentors, colleagues and people to talk to.</p>
            <p>Gemini's changeable and open mind makes them excellent artists, especially writers and journalists, and their skills and flexibility make them shine in trade, driving and team sports. This is a versatile, inquisitive, fun loving sign, born with a wish to experience everything there is out there, in the world. This makes their character inspiring, and never boring.<p>
            <p><b>Gemini - the Caring Twins</b> There is so much childish innocence in the nature of Gemini, telling their tale of brotherhood, love between best friends and relatives who are entirely different by character, circumstances, physical appearance or upbringing. They are in this world to mend differences and make them feel right, ready to give their life for a brother or a friend. Gemini Love and Sex Fun and always ready for an intellectual challenge, Gemini sees love first through communication and verbal contact, and find it as important as physical contact with their partner. When these two combine, obstacles all seem to fade. Inquisitive and always ready to flirt, a Gemini could spend a lot of time with different lovers until they find the right one who is able to match their intellect and energy. They need excitement, variety and passion, and when they find the right person, a lover, a friend and someone to talk to combined into one, they will be faithful and determined to always treasure their heart. </p>
            <br />
            <h2>CANCER<small>(June 21 - July 22)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Tenacious, highly imaginative, loyal, emotional, sympathetic, persuasive</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Moody, pessimistic, suspicious, manipulative, insecure</p>
            <p><b>Cancer likes:</b> Art, home-based hobbies, relaxing near or in water, helping loved ones, a good meal with friends</p>
            <p><b>Cancer dislikes:</b> Strangers, any criticism of Mom, revealing of personal life</p>
            <p>Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging zodiac signs to get to know. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about matters of the family and their home. Cancer is sympathetic and attached to people they keep close. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are very loyal and able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering.</p>
            <p>The sign of Cancer belongs to the element of Water, just like <a href="link4.html">Scorpio</a> and <a href="link6.html">Pisces</a>. Guided by emotion and their heart, they could have a hard time blending into the world around them. Being ruled by the Moon, phases of the lunar cycle deepen their internal mysteries and create fleeting emotional patterns that are beyond their control. As children, they don't have enough coping and defensive mechanisms for the outer world, and have to be approached with care and understanding, for that is what they give in return.</p>
            <p>Lack of patience or even love will manifest through mood swings later in life, and even selfishness, self-pity or manipulation. They are quick to help others, just as they are quick to avoid conflict, and rarely benefit from close combat of any kind, always choosing to hit someone stronger, bigger, or more powerful than they imagined. When at peace with their life choices, Cancer representatives will be happy and content to be surrounded by a loving family and harmony in their home.</p>
            <p><b>Cancer - the Brave Crab</b> Sent to this Earth by something they believe in, only to mess with someone bigger than they are, this isn't an animal aware of their strength. Patriotism can make them endanger their own wellbeing, fighting for someone else's cause, as if others can become their higher power. The Crab knows where they're going, but this is often in a wrong direction, at least until they learn their lessons and start relying solely on themselves.</p><br>
