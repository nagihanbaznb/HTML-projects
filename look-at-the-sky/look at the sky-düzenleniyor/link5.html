            <h2>SAGITTARIUS<small> (November 22 - December 21)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Generous, idealistic, great sense of humor</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Promises more than can deliver, very impatient, will say anything no matter how undiplomatic</p>
            <p><b>Sagittarius likes:</b> Freedom, travel, philosophy, being outdoors</p>
            <p><b>Sagittarius dislikes:</b> Clingy people, being constrained, off-the-wall theories, details</p>
            <p>Curious and energetic, Sagittarius is one of the biggest travelers among all zodiac signs. Their open mind and philosophical view motivates them to wander around the world in search of the meaning of life.</p>
            <p>Sagittarius is extrovert, optimistic and enthusiastic, and likes changes. Sagittarius-born are able to transform their thoughts into concrete actions and they will do anything to achieve their goals.</p>
            <p>Like the other fire signs, Sagittarius needs to be constantly in touch with the world to experience as much as possible. The ruling planet of Sagittarius is Jupiter, the largest planet of the zodiac. Their enthusiasm has no bounds, and therefore people born under the Sagittarius sign possess a great sense of humor and an intense curiosity.</p>
            <p>Freedom is their greatest treasure, because only then they can freely travel and explore different cultures and philosophies. Because of their honesty, Sagittarius-born are often impatient and tactless when they need to say or do something, so it's important to learn to express themselves in a tolerant and socially acceptable way.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>CAPRICORN<small> (December 22 - January 19)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Responsible, disciplined, self-control, good managers</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Know-it-all, unforgiving, condescending, expecting the worst</p>
            <p><b>Capricorn likes:</b> Family, tradition, music, understated status, quality craftsmanship</p>
            <p><b>Capricorn dislikes:</b> Almost everything at some point</p>
            <p>Capricorn is a sign that represents time and responsibility, and its representatives are traditional and often very serious by nature. These individuals possess an inner state of independence that enables significant progress both in their personal and professional lives. They are masters of self-control and have the ability to lead the way, make solid and realistic plans, and manage many people who work for them at any time. They will learn from their mistakes and get to the top based solely on their experience and expertise. </p>
            <p>Belonging to the element of Earth , like <a href="link1.html">Taurus</a>  and <a href="link3.html">Virgo</a>, this is the last sign in the trio of practicality and grounding. Not only do they focus on the material world, but they have the ability to use the most out of it. Unfortunately, this element also makes them stiff and sometimes too stubborn to move from one perspective or point in a relationship. They have a hard time accepting differences of other people that are too far from their character, and out of fear might try to impose their traditional values aggressively. </p>
            <p>Saturn is the ruling planet of Capricorn, and this planet represents restrictions of all kinds. Its influence makes these people practical and responsible, but also cold, distant and unforgiving, prone to the feeling of guilt and turned to the past. They need to learn to forgive in order to make their own life lighter and more positive. </p>
            <p><b>Capricorn   the Goat of Fear</b> A goat with the tail of a fish is created to face fear and create panic. It is the sign of decisions made to be protected from monsters in our minds, lives, and immediate physical surrounding. Always ready to transform into something that scares those scary things off, Capricorn speaks of each natural chain reaction of fear, where one scary thing leads to many others, rising up as defensive mechanisms that only make things worse. Immersed in their secrecy, they face the world just as they are   brave enough to never run away, but constantly afraid of their inner monsters. </p>
