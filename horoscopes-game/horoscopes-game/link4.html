            <h2>LIBRA<small> (September 23 - October 22)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Cooperative,diplomatic, gracious, fair-minded, social</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Indecisive, avoids confrontations, will carry a grudge, self-pity</p>
            <p><b>Libra likes:</b> Harmony, gentleness, sharing with others, the outdoors</p>
            <p><b>Libra dislikes:</b> Violence, injustice, loudmouths, conformity</p>
            <p>People born under the sign of Libra are peaceful, fair, and they hate being alone. Partnership is very important for them, as their mirror and someone giving them the ability to be the mirror themselves. These individuals are fascinated by balance and symmetry, they are in a constant chase for justice and equality, realizing through life that the only thing that should be truly important to themselves in their own inner core of personality. This is someone ready to do nearly anything to avoid conflict, keeping the peace whenever possible</p>
            <p>The sign of Libra is an Air sign, set between <a href="link2.html">Gemini</a> and <a href="link6.html">Aquarius</a>, giving these individuals constant mental stimuli, strong intellect and a keen mind. They will be inspired by good books, insurmountable discussions and people who have a lot to say. Each Libra representative has to be careful when talking to other people, for when they are forced to decide about something that is coming their way, or to choose sides, they suddenly realize that they might be in the wrong place and surrounded by wrong people. No partner should make them forget that they have their own opinion.</p>
            <p>Planet ruling the sign of Libra is Venus, making these people great lovers but also fond of expensive, material things. Their lives need to be enriched by music, art, and beautiful places they get a chance to visit. </p>
            <p><b>Libra – The Measure of Our Souls</b> The shortest myth of them all seems to present a good analogy to the shortest constellation in the sky, you might even say that it is non-existent, presented by the pliers of Scorpio. Libra is one dot of balance in the sea of different extremes, manifested only through the fifteenth degree of this magnificent sign, an object among animals and people. There is something awfully insecure about Libra, as if they were unsure which plate to burden next, aware that things pass and teach us to be careful around other people. Whatever we do in our lifetimes, only serves to point the way for our Souls towards that “higher power” to finally measure our existence. Telling us where we went wrong or what we did right, Libras unconsciously teach us that true liberation hides in lightness.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>SCORPIO<small> (October 23 - November 21)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Resourceful, brave, passionate, stubborn, a true friend</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Distrusting, jealous, secretive, violent</p>
            <p><b>Scorpio likes:</b> Truth, facts, being right, longtime friends, teasing, a grand passion</p>
            <p><b>Scorpio dislikes:</b> Dishonesty, revealing secrets, passive people</p>
            <p>Scorpio-born are passionate and assertive people. They are determined and decisive, and will research until they find out the truth. Scorpio is a great leader, always aware of the situation and also features prominently in resourcefulness.</p>
            <p>Scorpio is a Water sign and lives to experience and express emotions. Although emotions are very important for Scorpio, they manifest them differently than other water signs. In any case, you can be sure that the Scorpio will keep your secrets, whatever they may be.</p>
            <p>Pluto is the planet of transformation and regeneration, and also the ruler of this zodiac sign. Scorpios are known by their calm and cool behavior, and by their mysterious appearance. People often say that Scorpio-born are fierce, probably because they understand very well the rules of the universe. Some Scorpio-born can look older than they actually are. They are excellent leaders because they are very dedicated to what they do. Scorpios hate dishonesty and they can be very jealous and suspicious, so they need to learn how to adapt more easily to different human behaviors. Scorpios are brave and therefore they have a lot of friends.</p><br>
