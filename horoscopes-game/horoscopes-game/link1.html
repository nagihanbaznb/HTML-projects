            <h2>ARIES <small>(March 21 - April 19)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Courageous, determined, confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest, passionate</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Impatient, moody, short-tempered, impulsive, aggressive</p>
            <p><b>Aries likes:</b> Comfortable clothes, taking on leadership roles, physical challenges, individual sports</p>
            <p><b>Aries dislikes:</b> Inactivity, delays, work that does not use one's talents</p>
            <p>As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in everything - from work to social gatherings. Thanks to its ruling planet Mars and the fact it belongs to the element of Fire (just like <a href="link3.html">Leo</a> and <a href="link5.html">Sagittarius</a>), Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it well.</p>
            <p>The Sun in such high dignity gives them excellent organizational skills, so you'll rarely meet an Aries who isn't capable of finishing several things at once, often before lunch break!  Their challenges show when they get impatient, aggressive and vent anger pointing it to other people. Strong personalities born under this sign have a task to fight for their goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork through this incarnation.</p>
            <p>Aries rules the head and leads with the head, often literally walking head first, leaning forwards for speed and focus. Its representatives are naturally brave and rarely afraid of trial and risk. They possess youthful strength and energy, regardless of their age and quickly perform any given tasks.</p>
            <p><b>Guided by the story of the Golden Fleece</b> an Aries is ready to be the hero of the day, fly away and carry many endangered, powerless people on their back. The power of the ram is carried on his back, for he is the gold itself, shiny and attractive to those ready for betrayal. The story of glory that isn't easy to carry is in these two horns, and if this animal doesn't get shorn, allowing change and giving someone a warm sweater, they won't have much to receive from the world. Each Aries has a task to share their position, power, gold, or physical strength with other people willingly, or the energy will be stopped in its natural flow, fear will take over, and the process of giving and receiving will hold balance at zero. </p>
            <br />
            <h2>TAURUS <small>(April 20 - May 20)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Reliable, patient, practical, devoted, responsible, stable</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Stubborn, possessive, uncompromising</p>
            <p><b>Taurus likes:</b> Gardening, cooking, music, romance, high quality clothes, working with hands</p>
            <p><b>Taurus dislikes:</b> Sudden changes, complications, insecurity of any kind, synthetic fabrics</p>
            <p>Practical and well-grounded, Taurus is the sign that harvests the fruits of labor. They feel the need to always be surrounded by love and beauty, turned to the material world, hedonism, and physical pleasures. People born with their Sun in Taurus are sensual and tactile, considering touch and taste the most important of all senses. Stable and conservative, this is one of the most reliable signs of the zodiac, ready to endure and stick to their choices until they reach the point of personal satisfaction. </p>
            <p>Taurus is an Earth sign, just like <a href="link3.html">Virgo</a> and <a href="link5.html">Capricorn</a>, and has the ability to see things from a grounded, practical and realistic perspective. They find it easy to make money and stay on same projects for years, or until they are completed. What we often see as stubbornness can be interpreted as commitment, and their ability to complete tasks whatever it takes is uncanny. This makes them excellent employees, great long-term friends and partners, always being there for people they love. Earthly note makes them overprotective, conservative, or materialistic at times, with views of the world founded on their love of money and wealth. </p>
            <p>The ruler of Taurus is Venus, the planet of love, attraction, beauty, satisfaction, creativity and gratitude. This tender nature will make Taurus an excellent cook, gardener, lover, and artist. They are loyal and don't like sudden changes, criticism or the chase of guilt people are often prone to, being somewhat dependable on other people and emotions they seem to be unable to let go of. Still, no matter their potential emotional challenge, these individuals have the ability to bring a practical voice of reason in any chaotic and unhealthy situation.</p>
            <p><b>Taurus – the Wandering Bull</b> Being the one who betrayed their best friend, goddess Hera herself, this is an unfortunate being that has to wander the Earth in order to find freedom. As if something was always poking them behind their back, reminding them of happiness that once was, stinging and pushing forwards, they close up in their own worlds, lonely and separated from their core. To find love, a Taurus has to travel the world, change perspective or make a shift in their entire belief system and their system of values. </p>
