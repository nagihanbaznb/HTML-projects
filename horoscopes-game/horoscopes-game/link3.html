            <h2>LEO<small> (July 23 - August 22)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Creative, passionate, generous, warm-hearted, cheerful, humorous</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Arrogant, stubborn, self-centered, lazy, inflexible</p>
            <p><b>Leo likes:</b> Theater, taking holidays, being admired, expensive things, bright colors, fun with friends</p>
            <p><b>Leo dislikes:</b> Being ignored, facing difficult reality, not being treated like a king or queen</p>
            <p>People born under the sign of Leo are natural born leaders. They are dramatic, creative, self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist, able to achieve anything they want to in any area of life they commit to. There is a specific strength to a Leo and their "king of the jungle" status. Leo often has many friends for they are generous and loyal. Self-confident and attractive, this is a Sun sign capable of uniting different groups of people and leading them as one towards a shared cause, and their healthy sense of humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.</p>
            <p>
                Leo belongs to the element of Fire, just like <a href="link1.html">Aries</a> and <a href="link5.html">Sagittarius</a>. This makes them warmhearted, in love with life, trying to laugh and have a good time. Able to use their mind to solve even the most difficult problems, they will easily take initiative in resolving various complicated situations.
                Ruled by the Sun, Leo worships this fiery entity in the sky, quite literally as well as metaphorically. They are in search for self-awareness and in constant growth of ego. Aware of their desires and personality, they can easily ask for everything they need, but could just as easily unconsciously neglect the needs of other people in their chase for personal gain or status. When a Leo representative becomes too fond and attached to their achievements and the way other people see them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Leo - the Lion in the Cave</b> The story of the Lion always speaks of bravery. This is an animal fearless and impossible to challenge, hurt or destroy, their only weaknesses being fear and aggression towards those they confront.
                Living in a cave, a Lion always needs to have one, nesting and finding comfort in hard times. However, they should never stay there for long. With their head high, they have to face others with dignity and respect, never raising a voice, a hand, or a weapon, bravely walking through the forest they rule.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>VIRGO<small> (August 23 – September 22)</small></h2>
            <p><b>Strengths:</b> Loyal, analytical, kind, hardworking, practical</p>
            <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Shyness, worry, overly critical of self and others, all work and no play</p>
            <p><b>Virgo likes:</b> Animals, healthy food, books, nature, cleanliness</p>
            <p><b>Virgo dislikes:</b> Rudeness, asking for help, taking center stage</p>
            <p>Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they won’t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.</p>
            <p>Virgo is an Earth sign, fitting perfectly between <a href="link1.html">Taurus</a> and <a href="link5.html">Capricorn</a>. This will lead to a strong character, but one that prefers conservative, well-organized things and a lot of practicality in their everyday life. These individuals have an organized life, and even when they let go to chaos, their goals and dreams still have strictly defined borders in their mind. Constantly worried that they missed a detail that will be impossible to fix, they can get stuck in details, becoming overly critical and concerned about matters that nobody else seems to care much about.
            <p> Since Mercury is the ruling planet of this sign, its representatives have a well-developed sense of speech and writing, as well as all other forms of communication. Many Virgos may choose to pursue a career as writers, journalists, and typists, but their need to serve others makes them feel good as caregivers, on a clear mission to help. </p>
            <p><b>Virgo – the Disappointed Goddess</b> Seeking goodness in humankind is the story of Virgo, and disappointment seems to be inevitable from their point of view. The first time they came from their cloud and jumped onto planet Earth, it felt like their mission is to use their existence for good, discovering ways of justice and purity in other people. Once they fail to find it too many times, Virgos will pull away, get lost, turn to substance abuse, or simply separate from other people to sit on the bench, criticize and judge. </p>
